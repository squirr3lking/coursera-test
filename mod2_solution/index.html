		<p>Rhode Island Red didn't get his name from his rosy-hued comb and wattle - he got it from all his years in the pits. Only the best birds can fight Ol' Red: Arnie the Arucana, Lenny "the Gamecock" Leghorn, and Stumpy Bantam - the all-Chickanian lightweight Champion. All of them have fallen to Red. Rest assured, your dinner plate is graced with the cream of the crop.</p>

Our beef comes from hard-working, salt-of-the-earth cattle that put in 12-hour days and are thankful for it. Our cows wear leather not because it's trendy, but because it's a working cow's material - tough enough for any situation.</p>

After his capture at the battle of Ahi Poke, Titanius was executed as per the Bluefin custom - blood tunaed in front of his soliders. But Titanius would not give in... As his swim bladder was being cut out, he smiled. Then he laughed.</p>
