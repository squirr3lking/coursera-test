					<h3>Chicken</h3>			
						<p>Rhode Island Red didn't get his name from his rosy-hued comb and wattle - he got it from all his years in the pits. Only the best birds can fight Ol' Red: Arnie the Arucana, Lenny "the Gamecock" Leghorn, and Stumpy Bantam - the all-Chickanian lightweight Champion. All of them have fallen to Red. Rest assured, your dinner plate is graced with the cream of the crop.</p>

					<h3>Beef</h3>
						<p>Waygu? Kobe? No way. If you want to eat hipster cows, I hear California has a great selection. Our cows don't need massages or craft beer and they sure as hell don't brush their hides in public. Our beef comes from hard-working, salt-of-the-earth cattle that put in 12-hour days and are thankful for it. Our cows wear leather not because it's trendy, but because it's a working cow's material - tough enough for any situation.</p>

					<h3>Sushi</h3>
						<p>If one lives life on his own terms, how will he meet his end? Will he be dragged down by regrets of the past, or will he concede willingly, accepting his fate? Titanius had no regrets. After his capture at the battle of Ahi Poke, Titanius was executed as per the Bluefin custom - blood tunaed in front of his soliders. But Titanius would not give in... As his swim bladder was being cut out, he smiled. Then he laughed.</p>
